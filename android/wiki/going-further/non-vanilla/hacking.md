### ‚Ä¢ How do i install a Hack Client in PojavLauncher?
**‚Ä¢ For Wurst**
| Without Forge / With Optifine | With Forge | With Fabric |
|-----------------|------|---|
| Download [wurst](https://www.wurstclient.net/download/)(scroll down for 'e.g: MC 1.12.2 OF'), copy and paste to ```0/games/PojavLauncher/```, run the app, tap the ***Options, then Mod Installer (Forge, LabyMod, Forge etc..)*** ,scroll down until you see games, tap it, tap PojavLauncher, then tap [Wurst Installer.jar], wait if anyhing appears behind logs, tap '‚ùå'select your version, then move the mouse around to the 'install' tab. Wait for it to download, then tap **Force Close** and tap **Ok**.| **YOU MUST DOWNLOAD [FORGE](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) FIRST BEFORE PROCEEDING!** If you already installed forge, you're ready to proceed. Now, download [forgewurst](https://forge.wurstclient.net/), and copy the downloaded file to ```0/games/PojavLauncher/.minecraft/mods/```, and if you don't have 'mods' folder, make one. Now, open PojavLauncher, scroll to the version of forge you have installed, then enjoy hacking!| YOU NEED TO HAVE BOTH [FABRIC MOD INSTALLER](https://fabricmc.net/use/) AND [FABRIC API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) IN ORDER FOR THESE TO WORK! As of 1.16, Wurst now needs [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/) in order for the client to work. Installation is still the same with the '***WITH FORGE***' ones..|

**‚Ä¢ For Impact**

If we recall, Impact has several installation types. The table below will explain it.
| Official Launcher | Forge Mods | Forge + Liteloader | MultiMC Instance | Show Version JSON |
|---|---|---|---|---|

####  Other available options
- Minecraft Version: the area where you will select the minecraft version that you want Impact to install
- Impact Version: the area where you will select the Impact Version.
- Include Optifine: Includes optifine with Impact

### Supported Installation Type/s
NOTE: PojavLauncher supports 3 Impact Installation types, and those are **Official Launcher, which installs via PojavLauncher**, **Forge Mods, which installs for Forge**, and **Show Version JSON, which downloads a Impact JSON file.**

Installation is simple as 1, 2, 3. Dowmload [impact](https://impactclient.net/download?platform=jar), copy the downloaded file to ```0/games/PojavLauncher/```, open PojavLauncher, tap '**Options**', tap ***Mod Installer (Forge, LabyMod, Forge etc..)*** ,scroll down until you see games, tap it, tap PojavLauncher, then tap [ImpactInstaller-0.9.4.jar], wait if anyhing appears behind logs, tap '‚ùå',  nove the mouse around to the 'Install For' tab (move around to the üîª), select your prefered installation type, then move the mouse around to the '**Install**' tab, wait for it to dowmload (or showing 'Impact is successfully installed'), move around to the 'ok' tab, then tap **Force Exit**. Easy as that.
